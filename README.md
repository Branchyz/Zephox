# Zephox Engine

A C++ game engine still in development.

## The goal
- The main purpose of this engine is to learn from it.
- Both in game development and in C++.

## Inspiration 
This game engine is based on [Hazel Engine](https://hazelengine.com/).
I was inspired by [TheChermo](https://thecherno.com/) to start with C++.

## The name
It is pronounced like "zee-fox". It has no meaning. It was one of the first names that came to mind, it sounded good so I chose that name.
